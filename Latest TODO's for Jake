- Replace the temporary SMS service in `src/services/smsService.ts` with a real provider (e.g., Twilio) and remove `alert` calls and localStorage logging.
- Configure production environment variables for SMS API credentials and scheduling backend.
- Clean up any demo SMS logs stored in localStorage before launch.
- Investigate remaining React Router `act(...)` warnings in `__tests__/FormBuilder.test.tsx` and ensure routing updates are wrapped properly if desired.
- Review responsive layout of the Form Builder and other pages on mobile devices; adjust Tailwind classes as needed.
- Address npm warning about unknown `http-proxy` env config in deployment environment.
- Replace demo option values ("Option 1", "Option 2") for new checkbox and multi-select form blocks with real choices in production.
- Confirm backend handling and validation for checkbox and multi-select fields since client-side validation currently only checks for selections.
- Review intake form styling for the new checkbox and multi-select blocks on mobile devices and refine as needed.
