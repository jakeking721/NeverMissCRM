- Replace the temporary SMS service in `src/services/smsService.ts` with a real provider (e.g., Twilio) and remove `alert` calls and localStorage logging.
- Configure production environment variables for SMS API credentials and scheduling backend.
- Clean up any demo SMS logs stored in localStorage before launch.
- Investigate remaining React Router `act(...)` warnings in `__tests__/FormBuilder.test.tsx` and ensure routing updates are wrapped properly if desired.
- Review responsive layout of the Form Builder and other pages on mobile devices; adjust Tailwind classes as needed.
- Address npm warning about unknown `http-proxy` env config in deployment environment.
- Block deletion in the Form Builder only updates in-memory state until a form is saved; ensure no deleted blocks remain in the database after publishing. No new temporary data was added.
