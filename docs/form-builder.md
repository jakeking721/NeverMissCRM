# Form Builder Settings

The form builder now includes a **Form Settings** panel that lets you customize
the background color of the form preview.

## Background Color

- Use the color picker or hex input to set a background color.
- The chosen value is saved inside `schema_json.style.backgroundColor`.
- Existing forms without a style will default to `#f9fafb`.

When editing a form, changes are reflected live in the preview area and are
persisted when the form is saved.
